## InternVL-Chat-V1.2

In January 2024, we released InternVL-Chat-V1.1, which increased the resolution to 448x448, enhanced OCR capabilities, and better supported Chinese conversations. However, it still lagged behind existing SOTA in some benchmarks.

Today, we are excited to introduce InternVL-Chat-V1.2. Inspired by LLaVA-NeXT, we have also adopted [Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B) as the language model.
We find that a stronger language model can better leverage the powerful capabilities of our vision foundation model (InternViT-6B).
