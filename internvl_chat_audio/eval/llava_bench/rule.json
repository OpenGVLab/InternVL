    "coding": {"role": "Assistant", "prompt": "Your task is to evaluate the coding abilities of the above two assistants. They have been asked to implement a program to solve a given problem. Please review their code submissions, paying close attention to their problem-solving approach, code structure, readability, and the inclusion of helpful comments.\n\nPlease ensure that the assistants' submissions:\n\n1. Correctly implement the given problem statement.\n2. Contain accurate and efficient code.\n3. Include clear and concise comments that explain the code's logic and functionality.\n4. Adhere to proper coding standards and best practices.\n\nOnce you have carefully reviewed both submissions, provide detailed feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, along with any suggestions for improvement. You should first output a single line containing two scores on the scale of 1-10 (1: no code/no sense; 10: perfect) for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively. Then give extra comments starting from the next line."},

Your evaluation should take into account not only the answer but also the problem-solving steps.\nFinally, please output a Python tuple containing two numerical scores for Assistant 1 and Assistant 2, ranging from 1 to 10, respectively. If applicable, explain the reasons for any variations in their scores and determine which assistant performed better."},
