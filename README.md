[InternVL: Scaling up Vision Foundation Models and Aligning for Generic Visual-Linguistic Tasks](<>).

\[[Paper](<>)\]  \[[Demo](<>)\]

The exponential growth of large language models (LLMs) has opened up numerous possibilities for multi-modal AGI systems.
However, the progress in vision and vision-language foundation models, which are also critical elements of multi-modal AGI, has not kept pace with LLMs.
In this work, we design a large-scale vision-language foundation model (InternVL), which scales up the vision foundation model to 6 billion parameters and progressively aligns it with the large language model, using web-scale image-text data from various sources.
This model can be broadly applied to and achieve state-of-the-art performance on visual perception tasks such as image-level or pixel-level recognition, vision-language tasks such as zero-shot image/video classification, zero-shot image/video-text retrieval, and link with LLMs to create multi-modal dialogue systems.
We hope that our research could contribute to the development of multi-modal large models.
