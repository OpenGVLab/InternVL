# Mini-InternVL: A Flexible-Transfer Pocket Multimodal Model with 5% Parameters and 90% Performance

## Introduction

We introduce Mini-InternVL, a series of MLLMs with parameters ranging from 1B to 4B, which achieves 90% of the performance with only 5% of the parameters.
This significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness makes our models more accessible and applicable in various real-world scenarios.

- InternViT-300M

We employ InternViT-300M as our visual encoder, a lightweight vision model that inherits the capabilities of a powerful vision encoder. We directly leverage InternViT-6B that has undergone generative training on diverse datasets to transfer knowledge to a lightweight vision model, CLIP-ViT-L-336px.

- Adaptation for Mini-InternVL

To further promote the adoption of our models, we develop a unified adaptation framework for Mini-InternVL, which enables our models to transfer and outperform specialized models in downstream tasks, including autonomous driving, medical images, and remote sensing. We hope to provide insights into the application of MLLMs.

- We evaluate models using InternVL and VLMEvalKit repositories. AI2D, ChartQA, DocVQA, InfoVQA, and MMBench are tested with InternVL, while MathVistaand OCRBench use VLMEvalKit. For MMMU, we report scores from OpenCompass leaderboard.

- The Avg. Score is the average of the scores from all tested benchmarks, with the OCR-Bench score divided by 10. The values in parentheses represent the relative parameters and performance of Mini-InternVL compared to *InternVL2-Llama3-76B*, which is considered as 100%.

## Domain Adaptation

Visual tasks (*e.g.* Image classification, region perception, multi-view images tasks, video related tasks and visual grounding) can be  formulated into VQA format.
